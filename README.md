# Final Project: Mental Health Article Summarizer

**Course**: Web Mining & Applied NLP (44-620)  
**Student**: Kersha Broussard  
**Project**: Custom Article Summarizer using NLP and Web Scraping  
**Article Analyzed**: [Mental Health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health)

## üß† Project Overview
This project focuses on web mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques and uses Python, BeautifulSoup, spaCy, and spaCyTextBlob to mine/summarize a Wikipedia article on **Mental Health**. The process combines sentiment analysis, token/lemma frequency extraction, and intelligent sentence scoring to produce two versions of a text summary. 
- Most common words and ideas
- Sentiment (polarity) of the content
- Visualization of sentence relevance scores
- A generated summary using both token and lemma importance


## üõ† Tools & Libraries Used
- `requests`, `pickle` for HTML retrieval and storage
- `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing
- `spaCy` for NLP processing (tokenization, lemmatization, POS tagging)
- `TextBlob` for sentiment analysis
- `matplotlib` for histogram visualizations

## üîç Project Steps
1. **Web Scraping**: Fetched and saved the HTML from the Wikipedia article.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Used `TextBlob` to analyze polarity and subjectivity.
3. **spaCy Token & Lemma Frequency**: Identified the 5 most frequent tokens and lemmas (filtered and lowercased).
4. **Sentence Scoring**: Each sentence was scored by its frequency of interesting tokens/lemmas.
5. **Histograms**: Visualized token- and lemma-based sentence scores.
6. **Summary Generation**: Created two summaries (token-based and lemma-based) using a cutoff score.

## üìä Summary Stats
- **Original Article Sentence Count**: 387
- **Token Summary Sentence Count**: 53  
  - Polarity Score: `0.00097`
- **Lemma Summary Sentence Count**: 53  
  - Polarity Score: `0.00439`

## üí° Insights
- Most frequent tokens and lemmas highlighted recurring themes in the article.
- The summaries maintained the original sentence order and retained important information.
- Lemma-based scoring slightly outperformed token-based in terms of polarity.

## üìÅ Files Included
- `mental_health_article.pkl` ‚Äì HTML source
- `article_summarizer.ipynb` ‚Äì Full notebook with analysis, visualizations, and summaries
- Summary plots: token-based and lemma-based histograms

## üèÅ Skills Demonstrated
- Web scraping
- Sentiment analysis
- spaCy NLP techniques
- Data visualization
- Text summarization with sentence filtering
